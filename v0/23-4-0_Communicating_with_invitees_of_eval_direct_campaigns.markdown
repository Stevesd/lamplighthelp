# 23.4.0    Communicating with invitees of {{eval}} direct campaigns

> {{Lamplight}} lets you email invitees to {{eval}} direct campaigns: all of them, those that haven't responded, or those that have. 

To email invitees, view all campaigns [(Viewing campaigns 23.2.0)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.2.0)), right-click (or use the menu button) on the campaign you wish to view, and select the email option you need. The only difference is the recipient list.

__Communication Type__

In this tab, choose your dates (only for the record), and the work area.  'Type' will always be 'Email', and you can enter a 'Summary for saving'.  This will show in the table of communications.

__Recipients__

This will already be populated, by the type of invitees you chose when selecting the email option.  You may have multiple pages of recipients.  You can add or remove recipients if you choose.

__Email details__

* Subject: This is the subject of your email
* From: This is who the email will show as coming from.
* How do you want to send the emails: For emails to recipients, this will always show as a personalised email.

__Files__

Allows you to upload attachments to your message.  Please use Lamplight sparingly for this.

__Message content__

This allows you to compose your email, and to add merge fields and formatting.  In the top right of the text editing box, click the = symbol, to expand the text editing tools.

All the normal formatting options are displayed here, and can be used as normal.  You also have some mail merge options

* People mail merge:  Allows you to merge information from a person's profile.
* Evaluation campaign: Allows you to merge in information about the specific campaign you have selected to email about

If you have the communications module, you'll also see the two below.

* Document Templates: Allows you to use  a pre-set template, set-up by your system administrator
* Image library: Allows you to use a pre-loaded logo in your email.

When you have finished writing your email, click the 'create/send' button. Emails will be sent to each recipient with an email address. You will need to make alternative arrangements (downloading the url) for anyone without an email address [(Edit a campaign 23.3.0)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.3.0). 

Please also note that if you are using the campaign merge fields (for example 'campaign_url') the invitee list of the campaign must match the recipient list for the email, for the merge fields to correctly sync.
