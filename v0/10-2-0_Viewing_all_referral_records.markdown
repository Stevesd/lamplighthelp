# 10.2.0    Viewing all {{referral}} records

> To view all {{referral}} records, click '{{work}} -> view -> {{referral}}' on the main menu 

The {{referral}}s list shows additional information, including the referrer, and who the {{referral}} was made to.

![Viewing {{referral}}s]({{imgpath}}196a.png)

This lists all {{referral}} records that have occurred within a recent period of time, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top. (The default date ranges can be changed by your system administrator).  

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the '+' icon on the right of the Search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will reload. 

The context menu for the table has a number of options: right-click on a row of the table to see these. Some will be disabled, depending on the {{referral}} record. The options on this context menu are very similar to those for {{work}} records: see section [9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.0) for more information.
