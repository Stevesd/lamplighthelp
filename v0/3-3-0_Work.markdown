# 3.3.0    {{Work}}

> {{Lamplight}} stores details of the {{work}} you do (services you provide) as {{work}} records. 

{{Lamplight}} holds details of the {{work}} you do with your {{user}}s and others. These are called {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}. Each {{work}} record stores information about:

  * when and where it happened;
  * what happened; and
  * who was there.

Each {{work}} record is categorised by the type or area of work you are entering, known as a '{{workarea}}'. {{Workarea}}s in {{Lamplight}} are a way of categorising the different things that you do, to make it easier to sort, search and report on your {{work}} later. Each {{workarea}} can have {{subworkarea}}s below it.  You'll need to select a {{work area}} each time you enter a work record.
