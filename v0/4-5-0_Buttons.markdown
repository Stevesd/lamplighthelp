# 4.5.0    Buttons

> Buttons do more than click - some have menus too. 

Many screens have buttons that do particular things: usually adding or editing information, or saving it. Just click the button, normally located on the bottom right hand side.

Another type of button is called a 'Radio button', which are used for the workarea}}s, in the first tab of the Work Record.  When you select a radio button (to select a workarea}), you'll see another option appear from the left, where you can select a second option, as a subset of the first.  In this case, a {{workarea}}, and a {{subworkarea}} within that.  Each Main radio button has it's own set of sub-options.  You can only select one {{workarea}} at a time.

You can often also make multiple selections on these buttons. Select a{{workarea}} and you will see the {{subworkarea}}'s appear.  You can then select multiple subwork areas, simply by clicking  on the button. You can now select another {{subworkarea}} (from the same {{workarea}}) and it will be added again:
