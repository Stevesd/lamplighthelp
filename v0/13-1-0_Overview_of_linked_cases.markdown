# 13.1.0    Overview of {{linked case}}s

> {{Linked case}}s link different kinds of record ({{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{comm}}s etc) together, and allow you a different range of reorting options across the {{Linked case}} as a whole. 

{{Linked case}}s are a way of organising records within {{Lamplight}}. One person may have several {{linked case}}s; each {{linked case}} may involve several different people. There is a lot of flexibility so you can use them in the way that suits your way of working.

Using the options in the case, you may be able to select different types of cases, or record information, such as why the case has closed.

Different types of record can be linked together to form a single {{linked case}}. For example, one {{linked case}} may consist of 4 {{work}} records; some {{outcome}} measures; and a couple of {{comm}}s (if you have the {{comm}}s module). To link a particular record to a {{linked case}}, use the options on the right-click context menu.

{{Linked case}}s may be open or closed. You can only link records to open {{linked case}}s.
