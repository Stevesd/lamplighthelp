# 3.5.0    {{Group}}s

> {{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of {{people}} and/or {{organisations}, providing a list of names, and answering the question 'Show me {{people}} who... Once set-up, they provide a number of powerful features for reporting, and day to day activity.  There are Auto {{group}}s and Manual {{groups}} (and merge groups, which we'll come to later).

Each {{person}} or {{Organisation}} can belong to any number of {{group}}s.

You can use {{group}}s to:

  * develop complex, custom searches
  * speed up data entry - instead of entering each person's attendance individually into a new {{work}} record, just type in the {{group}} name and they'll all be added [(Attendance)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2)
  * communicate - you can create mail merges for all the members of a {{group}} [({{Comm}})](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.1.0)
  * {{report}} - groups can be used as filters in {{report}}s, to further focus your {{report}}ing when you need to [({{report}} filters)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1)

  **Displaying further information about {{people}} in groups**
  
  A {{Group}} Data View, lets you display information about those in a group, in a format similar to a spreadsheet or register.  This can be used on screen, printed, or downloaded to excel for further use.
