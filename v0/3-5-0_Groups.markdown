# 3.5.0    {{Group}}s

> {{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of people and/or organisations, providing a list of names of {{people}} or {{organisation}}s. Once set-up, they provide a number of powerful features for reporting, and day to day activity.

Lamplight has 'Manual {{group}}s', where you simply add and remove {{people}} manually yourself, and 'Auto {{group}}s' where you enter search criteria and the system locates the {{people}} or {{Organisation}}s who match the criteria.  For example you may create a group of male service users, aged 21-30, who have attended a particular service more than twice in the previous month.  Every time you run the group, the system identifies those who match the criteria, and refreshes the list of names.

Each {{person}} or {{Organisation}} can belong to any number of {{group}}s.

You can use {{group}}s to:

  * develop complex, custom searches
  * speed up data entry - instead of entering each person individually into a new {{work}} record, just type in the {{group}} name and they'll all be added
  * communicate - you can create mail merges for all the members of a {{group}}
  * {{report}} - groups can be used as filters in {{report}}s, so you can focus in your {{report}}ing when you need to

  **Displaying information about {{people}} in groups**
  
  A {{Group}} Data View, lets you display information about those in a group, in a format similar to a spreadsheet or register.  This can also be sorted, printed, or downloaded to excel for further use.
