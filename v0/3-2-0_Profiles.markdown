# 3.2.0    Profiles

> Every {{person}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. A profile is a way of bringing together all information about a person in one place, information about them, and information about what you do with them.

Every individual and every organisation has a profile. This holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}. To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, you can use the search box in the top right of the screen.  Start typing their name in the search box and when they appear on the drop-down list, click their name.  You can search by name, postcode or Lamplight ID number.

If you have many people with the same name, you can type in the name you want and click the 'Go' button.  This will give you a full list of anything in the system which matches what you have typed.

Every system will have different tabs, though almost all will start with the Contact Details tab.  The first tabs will normally contain demographic information or information about people, and the later ones information on the activities you do with them.

Your system administrator can add additional tabs and their contents, that you will seeon the profile page. You will often see different tabs, depending on the type of individual or organisation you are looking at.  You may for example see different tabs in a profile for a {{user}}, member of {{staff}} or an organisation. Different {{Lamplight}} {{Project}}s may also show different tabs and fields.
