# 2.0.0    Introduction

> An overview of {{Lamplight}} and the contents of the online help system. 

Welcome to the {{Lamplight}} help system.

Lamplight is designed as a fully featured management system for charities and voluntary sector organisations, and this help section will help you navigate it.  There are two ways of using the system.  If you are new to Lamplight we suggest you start with our basic training videos, and working through the first few sections.  These will walk you through using {{Lamplight}} day to day.  If you are looking for specific information, we'd encourage you to go directly to the section you need.  Each section starts with a brief summary or 'how-to'; you may only need to read the summary for a quick reminder. Each section then has detailed text and in many cases screenshots that explains in detail how to accomplish a particular task or use a feature of Lamplight.
