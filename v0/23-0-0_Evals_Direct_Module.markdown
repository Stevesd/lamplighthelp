# 23.0.0    {{Eval}}s Direct Module

> The {{Eval}}s Direct Module works with the {{Eval}}s Module, to allow you to create online links to your existing survey/{{eval}} data, which you can send to your end users to complete.  This module is known as DataDirect.

Using Lamplight, you can send out one link to everyone, or a different link to each person, tracking who has responded, and with what information, using the {{eval}}s module.  The information they complete is entered automatically into Lamplight, and ready for your analysis.

To do this you set-up an {{eval}}s Direct campaign, that identifies which {{eval}} you will be using, who you want to send it to, and when.
