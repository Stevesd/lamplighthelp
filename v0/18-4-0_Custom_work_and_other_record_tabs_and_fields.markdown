# 18.4.0    Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields

> It is possible to add additional tabs and fields to your {{work}}, {{outcome}} and other records through System Administration.

In the section 'Manage drop-down lists' you'll see options at the bottom to add for each type of record.

Each type of record works on the same principle, with the example below being for work records.  
The system is almost identical to adding Custom tabs and fields on profiles.  Please ensure you are familier with this section first.  See:

__Adding fields to a work record__

Choose 'View, add and edit custom field on work records.  You'll see three columns, with the first showing you a list of tabs available on your work records.  Depending on your set-up you may see one or more of the three standard fields on the work record (When and where, Attendance, Details).  This is where you have custom fields added to these tabs.  You'll also see any custom tabs you have created.

Click on a tab on the left, and you'll see the fields for that tab in the centre column.  If you then click on a field, you'll see the field information, and options if applicable in the right column.  As shown below.

__Creating a new tab__

To create a new tab, select the button 'Click here to add' in the left hand column.  You'll see a small pop-up box.  This will open a small pop-up box with the tab information.  In here you can name the tab, and select various options.  Some of these options are redundant in records, and apply only to profile fields.

* What type of person is this for:  No answer is able to selected here, as records show all fields for all users.
* Restrict this field to managers/admins?:  Although you can tick this field, it does not function in this record.
* Projects: You can select which projects (If you have more than one project) this field should display for.
* You may also see fields about publishing, if you have the publishing module.  See: 
Click 'Save' to save the tab.

__Important__ You must always add a field to a tab, to ensure it remains editable and visible in System Administration.  If you do not, you'll have an empty tab in your record which you will be unable to edit.  In this case, please contact Lamplight for support.
