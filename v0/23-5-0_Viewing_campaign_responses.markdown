# 23.5.0    Viewing campaign responses

> View aggregated responses via the DataDirect -> {{eval}} campaigns -> view. 

To view a {{report}} of your campaign responses, view all campaigns [(Viewing campaigns 23.3.0)](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.3.0), and use the menu on the campaign you wish to view to and select 'view {{report}} of responses'

This will take you directly to the {{Eval}}s {{report}}.  This works in exactly the same way as a normal evaluations report [({{eval}} reporting 17.5.0)](help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.5.0) Simply set the dates and other details from your campaign dates, and click 'Fetch data' to show the results.

From there you can carry out further analysis and download the results
