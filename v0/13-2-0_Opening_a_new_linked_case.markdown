# 13.2.0    Opening a new {{linked case}}

You can create a new {{Linked case}} either through the '{{linked case}} View' tab, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a {{linked case}}.

__Through the '{{linked case}} View' tab.__

If you scroll down to the bottom of this tab, you'll see a section called 'Create a new {{linked Case}}'.

This will include the {{linked case}} name, and the date.  Your organisation will likely have a convention for naming {{linked case}}s.  For example you may have the {{user}} name, followed by the day; or intials followed by the issue the {{linked case}} is about.
You may have additional options which you can choose, and which you may complete at different stages of the {{linked case}}. Complete any which are relevent.  You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{linked case}} description'.

Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the {{linked case}}.

__While linking a record to the {{linked case}}__

Using the context menu from a view of {{work}} or other records, you can choose the 'Link to {{linked case}}' option, which will create a pop-up box, the same as above.  As you type, matches to existing {{linked case}}s will be displayed, or you can enter a new {{linked case}} name, complete the details as above, and save.
