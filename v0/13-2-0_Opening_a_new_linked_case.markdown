# 13.2.0    Opening a new {{linked case}}

You can create a new {{Linked case}} either through the '{{linked case}} View' tab, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a case.

__Through the '{{linked case}} View' tab.__

If you scroll down to the botton of this tab, you'll see a section called 'Create a new Case'.

This will include the case name, (which is often the name of the {{user}}), and the date.  You may have additional optins which you can choose, and which you may complete at different stages of the case. Complete any which are relevent.  You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{Linked case}} description'.

Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the case.

__While linking a record to the case__

Using the context menu from a view of {{work}} or other records, you can choose the 'Link to case' option, which will create a pop-up box, the same as above.  You can search for an existing case by name, or you can enter a new case name, complete the details, and save.

Matches will be displayed in a drop-down as you type, and you can either select one of these to use the existing {{linked case}}, or ignore them to create a new one. To create the link (and if you are adding a new {{linked case}}, to save the {{linked case}} details), click the 'save' button in the bottom right of the popup window. The main listing of {{work}} records will be refreshed, showing the link to the {{linked case}} that's just been added. Once you have created a new {{linked case}}, this will appear in the drop-down when you come to add more records to the {{linked case}}.

In a profile, you can also drag one record onto another to create a link.
