__copying personal settings__
You can choose to copy personal settings from another member of staff.  When setting up a system your implementer is likely to have set-up personal settings to give you the experience you recognise.  It's normal when creating a new user to copy personal settings from another member of staff.  You can read more about personal settings at: [18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0). 

When you click 'save' to create the new operator, they will be emailed their new password and login details. The system will also create a profile for that person, setting them as a member of {{staff}}. To view this profile click 'View full details' on the context menu. See section [8.3.0  Profiles](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0) for more about profiles. 

__Password issues__

If the new password does not arrive, then it is most likely to be an issue with the recipients email spam filter.  Most inboxes have a spam folder you can check.  If you are using a dummy email address however, or are not able to locate it, you can reset the password again.  Using the context menu for the person whose password you which to set, choose the option 'Reset password'.  This resends the email with a new password, and displays the new password in a pop-up box.  You can write down the new password or take a screenshot and share it as appropriate.
