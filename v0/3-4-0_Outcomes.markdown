# 3.4.0    {{Outcome}}s

> {{Outcome}}s in {{Lamplight}} measure the change over time you see in the {{people}} you {{work}} with. 

{{Outcome}}s are the impact your {{work}} has on individuals or organisations, the changes over time that they or you observe. The core {{Lamplight}} system enables you to take a series of 'snapshots' at different times, and see how those snapshots change as time goes by.

If you ask a {{user}} or anyone else, exactly the same questions at different stages of their enagagement with you, and compare the change in their results over time, this is an {{Outcome}} in {{Lamplight}}.  To assess outcome changes you always need more than one data-point, that is, to have asked the use the questions more than one time.

For example, your organisation may be working to improve the self-confidence of the people you {{work}} with. In January you would measure how confident John felt on a scale of 1-10 and enter it into {{Lamplight}}. A couple of months later, you measure John again. Then three months later still, you ask John again how confident he feels. In five months you can demonstrate improvement in John's confidence.

{{Lamplight}} lets you follow what happens to individuals (in their profiles), but also to see the overall impact for everyone you are working with through outcome reporting (link below).  This kind of ({{outcome}}) data, where you follow what happens to particular individuals over a period of time, is called 'panel data'. 

**Other ways of measuring**

The other way of assessing impact is by surveying a sample of people every now and again - for example, sending out an anonymous questionnaires to 10% of your {{user}}s every 6 months.  In this case a single survey will give you the information you need. 
This kind of date is known as 'latitudinal data', and can be integrated into Lamplight using the Evaluations Module (link below)
